Wide ASPECS

This repo contains the code used for the first Master's Research project at Leiden University. The scripts specifically used in the final figures and calculations are ```run_matching.py``` in ```independent```, ```plot_wide_aspecs.py``` to create the cutouts, and ```clustering.py``` in ```Clustering```. Other scripts were used for data exploration and other lines of inquiry. 

The repo will not work without the data, which is currently not available.

This project focused on studying CO emitters within the Wide ASPECS field, which is the third ASPECS survey to have been conducted. More information on ASPECS is available at http://www.mpia.de/~ASPECS/index.php
